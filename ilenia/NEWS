30/12/2004 - ilenia-1.1 released
Ilenia now with some new features like the secure removing 
of packages ("secure" means "with dependencies check").
With ilenia 1.1 you can store your ports tree in more
floxible way: ilenia knows where you have the ports tree
reading from .cvsup and .httpup file; for example you can
store ports from crux (base and opt), crux-it, clc and 
various people in different directories under /usr/ports, 
something like:

/usr/ports/clc:
contrib/  unmaintained/

/usr/ports/crux:
base/  opt/

/usr/ports/it:
devel/  games/  gnome/  multimedia/  network/  office/  science/  system/  x11/

/usr/ports/people:
acrux/  chw/   jaeger/  jolupa/  maol/        ogg/   sten/    tilman/    yankeegohome/
alan/   dahl/  jdolan/  jue/     mhedenskog/  pazo/  stsp/    vico/      yhafri/
albe/   han/   jheino/  jw/      noneus/      rrm3/  tbmnet/  wimpress/  zh_current/

The dependencies system of ilenia had been improved very much in this release.
