11/03/2006 - ilenia-2.0 released
There are many new things in this release: beginning from the sourcecode that
had been rewritten to have a better usage of memory and an "unified error and
warning message system", all error and warning messages are managed by two
function. 
The more tangible, for the user, new features are: 
- the "not found policy", when a dependence isn't found ilenia can act in three
  ways asking you if she can procede (setting this variable as "Ask", the
  default), stopping the build and install process (setting this variable as
  "Stop") or contnuing with next package (setting the value "Nevermind"); 
- the introduction of "/etc/favoritepkgmk", to use a non default pkgmk.conf for
  certain packages;
- the "sysupng", during a system update (`ilenia -U`), the packages won't be
  updated merely in alphabetic order but with dependencies check; for example if
  gtk and pango are out of date, ilenia updates pango before of gtk.  

14/12/2005 - ilenia-1.5 released
This release has a full support for rsync repository.

02/10/2005 - ilenia-1.4 released
In every new release there are innovations and bugfixes:
alias list (/etc/ports/alias) and search function (-s)
are the innovations; fixed segafaults with ports with 
bad version field and many other things that I don't 
remember because I've made them many days ago are
bugfixes.

25/03/2005 - ilenia-1.3 released
The more obvious innovation in this release are the 
introduction of local repositories and POST_PKGADD commands
definables in /etc/ilenia.rc. But the are many innovation's
in the code that renders ilenia more powerful and secure.

29/01/2005 - ilenia-1.2 released
A little bugfix release for x86's users, a great release for
ppc's users: from this release ilenia has the full support
for .cvs supfiles of crux ppc.

30/12/2004 - ilenia-1.1 released
Ilenia now with some new features like the secure removing 
of packages ("secure" means "with dependencies check").
With ilenia 1.1 you can store your ports tree in more
floxible way: ilenia knows where you have the ports tree
reading from .cvsup and .httpup file; for example you can
store ports from crux (base and opt), crux-it, clc and 
various people in different directories under /usr/ports, 
something like:

/usr/ports/clc:
contrib/  unmaintained/

/usr/ports/crux:
base/  opt/

/usr/ports/it:
devel/  games/  gnome/  multimedia/  network/  office/  science/  system/  x11/

/usr/ports/people:
acrux/  chw/   jaeger/  jolupa/  maol/        ogg/   sten/    tilman/    yankeegohome/
alan/   dahl/  jdolan/  jue/     mhedenskog/  pazo/  stsp/    vico/      yhafri/
albe/   han/   jheino/  jw/      noneus/      rrm3/  tbmnet/  wimpress/  zh_current/

The dependencies system of ilenia had been improved very much in this release.

7/11/2004 - ilenia-1.0 released
Now 'ilenia' can build, install and update packages
while resolving the dependencies too.
