.SH NAME
ilenia \- update/list ports collection and compile-install/update packages with dependencies
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBilenia [options] [collection] [packages]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBilenia\fP was a replacement of the standard CRUX ports tool.
\fBilenia\fP connects to one or more master repositories and updates the local copy of a
ports collection. If no collections are specified then all collections will be updated.
\fBilenia\fP, now can also update, install and remove a packages with relatives 
dependencies; \fBilenia\fP chooses which port (with same name) to 
compile and install in the "ilenia --updated" way: she, if there is the same port in 
different repos, and if the port/package isn't controlled by favoriterepo or 
favoriteversion, compile and install the one with newer version.
A \fIport\fP is a directory containing all necessary files for building a software package using pkgmk(8).
