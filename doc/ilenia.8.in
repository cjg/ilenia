.SH NAME
ilenia \- update/list ports collection and compile-install/update packages with dependencies
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBilenia [options] [collections or packages]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBilenia\fP was a replacement of the standard CRUX ports tool.
\fBilenia\fP connects to one or more master repositories and updates the local copy of a
ports collection. If no collections are specified then all collections will be updated.
\fBilenia\fP, now can also update, install and remove a packages with relatives 
dependencies; \fBilenia\fP chooses which port (with same name) to 
compile and install in the "ilenia --updated" way: if there is the same port in 
different repos, and if the port/package isn't controlled by favoriterepo or 
favoriteversion, che compiles and installs the one with newer version.
A \fIport\fP is a directory containing all necessary files for building a software package using pkgmk(8).

.SH LOCAL REPOSITORY
.TP
You can use local repository on your machine. To let ilenia recognize them you have to create a file in "/etc/ports/" with ".local" extension (for example: my.local); this file must be a single row, where there is specified the fullpath of the local repository.
For example:

# my.local

PATH="/home/ports"

# End of file
.SH FILES
.TP
.B "/usr/ports/"  
Root of local ports collection.
.TP
.B "/etc/ports/"
Directory for port collection configuration.
.TP
.B "/etc/ports/favoriterepo"
File where the informations about the favorite repository are stored.
.TP
.B "/etc/ports/favoriteversion"
File where the informations about the favorite version are stored.
.TP
.B "/etc/ports/alias"
File where the informations about the alias are stored.
In each row could be a list of equivalent packages (such as: sendmail exim postfix). Ilenia don't install a package as dependencies if you have an equivalent ones installed.
.TP
.B "/etc/ports/favoritepkgmk"
File where the informations to let ilenia use non default pkgmk.conf for certain packages are stored.
.TP
.B "/etc/ilenia.rc"
File contening optional features like "POST_PKGADD"
.SH POST_PKGADD
.TP
In your ilenia.rc you can specify a command, or some commands, to be executed after each installation of packages; the commands are executed in the, just compiled and installed, ports dir. 
For example, I use:

POST_PKGADD  = "pkgmk \-c; aplay /home/slash/sounds/grolsch_plop.wav"
.SH ASK_FOR_UPDATE
.TP
When you are trying to update all packages, ilenia asks you if you're sure to do that. If you like, the old way: without any question; you can set the ASK_FOR_UPDATE variable to "No" (I use this).
.SH NOT_FOUND_POLICY
.TP
When a dependence isn't found ilenia can act in three ways: asking you if she can procede (setting this variable as "Ask", the default), stopping the build and install process (setting this variable as "Stop") or contnuing with next package (setting the value "Nevermind").
.SH REPOS_HIERACHY
.TP
Specifies the hierachy of repositories: the first repository in the list has the higher priority, the repositories not included in this list have lower priority. favoriterepo has priority over REPOS_GERARCHY
