.SH NAME
ilenia \- A package manager for CRUX (and CRUX PPC of course) 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBilenia ACT [OPTION(S)] [ARG(S)]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
ilenia is a complete and probably simple to use ports packages manager for CRUX
and CRUX PPC. With the different actions it is possible to install, update or
remove packages checking the dependencies; it is possible to search for ports by
their name or by the description field; it is possible to obtain lists or trees
of the dependencies or dependents of a port or of some ports and it is possible
to see a list of ports with different version from the ones in the ports tree or
with lower version than the ones in the ports tree.
.br
.PP
.B "The locked version, favourite repository, repositories hierarchy, higher version rule."
.br
The rule for install or update a port is the locked version, favourite
repository, repositories hierarchy, higher version one: if a port is contained
in the locked versions list it will be installed (if it is found) only with the
specified version; then if a port is contained in the favourite repositories it
will be installed or updated only from the associated repository; if the port
isn't contained by the locked versions or the favourite versions, and it is
found in more than one repository it is installed from the repository with
higher priority (that compares first in the repositories hierarchy); finally if
the port is found more than in one repository with the same priority it is
installed the one with higher version.
.SH ACTIONS
.TP
.B "\-d, \-\-diff"
Shows the list of the installed packages with different version from the ones in
the ports tree.
.TP
.B "\-D, \-\-dependencies"
Shows the list of the dependencies of the port(s) in ARG(S). This action can be
used with the "\-\-verbose" option to obtain more information (such as the
repository where the port is found, or i the port has a README) for each port in
the list.
.TP
.B "\-i, \-\-info"
Shows information about the port(s) in ARG(S).
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-list"
Shows the list of the ports from all repositories, or if some arguments are
supplied shows the list of the ports founded from the repositories in ARG(S).
.TP
.B "\-p, \-\-updated"
Shows the list of the installed packages with lower version from the ones in the
ports tree. The list is built according to the repositories hierarchy, locked
versions and favourite repository rules.
.TP
.B "\-\-repository\-list"
Shows the list of the repositories used by ilenia.
.TP
.B "\-R, \-\-remove"
Removes the packages in ARG(S). Used with the "\-\-all" option removes the
packages in ARG(S) and the packages that depends from them.
.TP
.B "\-s, \-\-search"
Searches for the ARG(S) in the ports tree by name. It is allowed using wildcards
in ARG(S). It's possible using the "\-\-verbose" option to obtain more details
for founded ports.
.TP
.B "\-\-search\-desc"
Searches for the ARG(S) in the ports tree by description. It is allowed using
wildcards in ARG(S). It's possible using the "\-\-verbose" option to obtain more
details for founded ports.
.TP
.B "\-T, \-\-dependents"
Shows the list of the ports that require the port(s) in ARG(S) as
dependencies. Defaultly the list contains only installed ports (packages), it's
possible using the "\-\-all" option to obtain a complete list. This action can
be used with the "\-\-verbose" option to obtain more information (such as the
repository where the port is found, or i the port has a README) for each port in
the list.
.TP
.B "\-u, \-\-update"
Updates the repository in ARG(S) or, if no ARG is supplied, updates the entire
ports tree.
.TP
.B "\-U, \-\-update\-pkg"
Updates or installs the port(s) in ARG(S) and their dependencies. If no ARG is
supplied the entire system (all packages that have to be updated) will be
updated.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-\-all"
It is used with the "\-\-remove" or the "\-\-dependents" action to,
respectively, remove all dependents packages or show all dependents packages.
.TP
.B "\-\-cache"
Forces the rebuild of the cache.
.TP
.B "\-\-fetch-only"
It is used with the "\-\-update\-pkg" action, it forces to download only the
required sources of the ports. 
.TP
.B "\-\-no\-aliases"
Ignores the aliases list.
.TP
.B "\-\-no\-colors"
Disables the colored output.
.TP
.B "\-\-no\-favourite"
Ignores the favourite repositories list.
.TP
.B "\-\-no\-hierarchy"
Ignores the repositories hierarchy. This could be dangerous, probably.
.TP
.B "\-\-no\-locked"
Ignores the locked versions list.
.TP
.B "\-\-tree"
It is used with the "\-\-dependencies" or the "\-\-dependents" actions to obtain
a tree instead of a list of dependencies or dependents ports.
.TP
.B "\-\-verbose"
It is used with the "\-\-dependencies", the "\-\-dependents", the "\-\-\search"
or the "\-\-search\-desc" actions to obtain more information.
.TP
.B "\-?, \-\-help"
Shows an help screen.
.TP
.B "\-\-usage"
Shows a brief usage message.
.TP
.B "\-V, \-\-version"
Shows the version.
.SH CONFIGURATION: /etc/ilenia.conf
The configuration file is "/etc/ilenia.conf", it is composed by four sections:
"ilenia", "favourite_repositories", "locked_versions", "aliases", "pkgmk_confs".
.br
The "[ilenia]" sections contains the configuration variables, these variables
can be overrated on the fly setting environment variables. The variables are:
.TP
.B POST_PKGADD
It contains the commands to be executed after a success "pkgadd" (after the
installation of a single package). For default this variable is empty: no action
is performed after a pkgadd.
.TP
.B NOT_FOUND_POLICY
It configures the policy when a dependence port isn't found in the ports
tree. The possible values are: "Ask", the default one, that stops the execution
and ask the user if it is possible to continue; "Stop", that stops immediately
the execution; "Nevermind", that prints out a warning and ignores the not found
port and continues the execution.
.TP
.B REPOSITORIES_HIERARCHY
It configures the repositories hierarchy, the value is a list of repositories
separated by space, the first repository in the list is the repository with
higher priority.
.TP
.B ASK_FOR_UPDATE
Possible values are "Yes", the default one and "No"; setting this variable to
"Yes" before updating any package shows the list of ports to be installed or
updated and asks the user if is it possible to continue.
.TP
.B ENABLE_COLORS
It enables or disables the colored output, possible values are "Yes", the
default and "No".
.TP
.B VERBOSE
It enables the verbosity for default (like using always the "\-\-verbose"
option), possible values are "Yes" and "No", the default one.
.PP
The section "[favourite_repositories]" configures the favourite repositories; a
port in this list can be updated or installed only from the associated
repository. The syntax is a couple of port name, repository name 
("port = repository") separated by newline, it is allowed using wildcards in
port name. For example:
.br
.br
[favourite_repositories]
.br
gcc = core
.br
xorg-* = xorg
.br
.PP
The section "[locked_versions]" configures the ports to be installed or updated
only at associated version. The syntax is a couple of port name, version
("port = version") separated by newline. For example:
.br
.br
[locked_versions]
.br
ilenia = 3.0-1
.br
glibc = 2.3.6-2
.br
.PP
The section "[aliases]" configures the aliases list; a port that is an alias of
another one has the same functions and can be substituted to this in
dependencies, for example it is possible to use "xorg" as an alias for "x11":
the ports that requires "x11" works (almost always) also if it is installed
"xorg". The syntax is like the ones of the "favourite_repositories" or the
"locked_versions" sections:
.br
.br
[aliases]
.br
x11 = xorg
.br
sendmail = exim postfix
.br
.PP
The section "[pkgmk_confs]" configures the ports to be built using the
non-default pkgmk configuration file (/etc/pkgmk.conf). The syntax is: 
"port = /path/to/pkgmk.conf"; it is allowed using wildcard in port's names.
.SH LOCAL REPOSITORIES
.PP
Local repositories are repositories that resides only on the local machine
created by the local sysadmin. To let ilenia recognize the admin have to create
a file in "/etc/ports/" with ".local" extension (for example: my.local); this
file must be a single row, where there is specified the full path of the local
repository. For example:
.br
# my.local
.br
.br
PATH="/root/ports"
.br
.br
# End of file
